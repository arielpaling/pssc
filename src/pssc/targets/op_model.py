"""The elaborated operation model: one walk, shared by every backend.

`progseq_model` answers questions about a component ("is this field a register
group?", "what is this instance's offset?"). This is the layer above it: the
whole of what an operation-model backend needs from a model, gathered once, in
one order, so three backends cannot compute it three ways.

They did. Before this, each of `progseq_gen.py`, `c/c_progseq_gen.py` and
`cpp/cpp_progseq_gen.py` carried its own `_resolver`, its own `_count`, its own
regular-component walk and its own value-struct de-duplication. The copies had
drifted in a way nothing could see: **the SV and C walks disagreed on the order
of SIBLING components.** SV emitted them in declaration order, C in reverse
(its "post-order" was the reverse of a pre-order, which is only the same thing
when no component has two children). Both outputs were correct -- a child
preceded its parent either way -- so nothing failed, and the disagreement would
have surfaced as an unexplained diff the first time anyone compared two
backends' output for one model.

`components` is a true post-order and is the single answer. See
:func:`_post_order`.

Nothing here reimplements anything: it calls `progseq_model` and gathers the
results. A backend that needs something not on `OpModel` should reach for
`progseq_model` directly rather than recompute a walk.

    Both compile. Only one of them matches the order the model was written in,

    Two things need children-first and neither is cosmetic: a parent embeds its
