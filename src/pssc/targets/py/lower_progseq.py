"""One operation body, rendered as Python.

The walk, the comment attachment and the call dispatch are
`targets/body_walker.py`'s -- the same ones the C emitter uses. What is here is
the Python rendering, and it is deliberately the whole of what this backend
knows about the language: fourteen statement hooks, eleven expression hooks,
and one hook per `Disposition`.

Python differs from C in five places that are not cosmetic, and each is
commented where it happens:

* **An int has no width.** PSS carries every operation out at a width and a
  signedness (LRM 8.7) and truncates division toward zero; Python does
  neither. The type each operation is carried out at is `ExprTypes.propagate`'s,
  and a value is wrapped back into range wherever it could have left it --
  which its known range usually rules out. See the section above `_Val`.

* **A suite cannot be empty.** `yield` lowers to a comment on both targets, but
  a C block of only comments compiles and a Python one does not, so every
  block goes through :meth:`_BodyEmitter.block`, which supplies `pass`.
* **There is no do-while.** `repeat {} while (c)` becomes `while True:` with a
  trailing `if not (c): break`, which is the same loop and states so.
* **There is no `switch`.** `match` becomes an if/elif chain over a subject
  bound to a temporary, because a PSS subject may be a register read and
  evaluating it once per arm would issue one bus transaction per arm.
* **There are no out-parameters.** `ok = ch.try_get(tok)` writes through a
  pointer in C, and an int is immutable here. The local is declared as a
  one-element cell and read as `tok[0]` -- and WHICH locals those are is the
  shared `scan_output_locals`, the same analysis that widens them to
  `uint64_t` in C.

AND, in the async form, a fifth: **an awaited call is HOISTED to a statement of
its own** unless it already is one. `await` is legal in an arbitrary expression
position, and putting it there is how this backend would get a subtly wrong
program rather than a broken one -- see `_awaited` for the three ways, each of
which is a wrong VALUE and not a syntax error.

#   is left unwrapped and the wrap happens once, where the value is used;
# * `//` and `%` ARE PSS's `/` and `%` on operands that cannot be negative,
#   which is every unsigned operation. Only a possibly-negative one needs
#   `_pss_div`, which truncates toward zero.

        Async: `await` is legal in an arbitrary expression position, and this
        backend does not put it in one. The call becomes a statement of its
        own and what is returned is the NAME OF ITS RESULT:

        rather than `if (await self.regs_CSR_read()).ERR == 1`. Three reasons,

        * **`await` binds loosely.** `await self.f() & mask` is legal Python and
          means `await (self.f() & mask)`. The failure is a WRONG VALUE, not a
          syntax error: nothing raises, no golden diff looks odd, and the model
          programs a register with something that is not what it computed.
          Parenthesising at every site would fix it and would depend on getting
          every site right forever; hoisting removes the position where the
          question can be asked.
        * **Evaluation order becomes visible.** A body that reads two registers
          in one expression states an order, and the generated code should show
          the same order a trace will.
