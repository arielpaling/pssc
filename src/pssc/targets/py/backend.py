"""Assemble a PSS operation model into one Python module.

Built as a class, and for the same two reasons `c/backend.py` is:

* **Every `emit_*` returns text; only `generate`/`write_files` touch disk.** A
  method that writes cannot be wrapped by a subclass calling `super()`, which is
  the whole point of the class.
* **The module is exactly its `sections()`**, in order, each section carrying
  its own trailing blank -- so a subclass changes one by name
  (`targets/sections.py`) rather than by re-deriving the whole file.

ONE FILE, unlike C's header/implementation pair. Python has no separate
declaration to keep in step, and splitting a generated model across modules
would buy nothing but an import cycle between a component and its parent.

WHAT THE GENERATED MODULE IMPORTS: nothing outside the STANDARD LIBRARY,
unless the model has channels. That is a property worth keeping rather than an
accident -- a generated driver gets copied onto a lab machine, and a single
file needing no install is one that still runs there. The platform seam is
structural: the module generates its own `Protocol` for it and requires nothing
to inherit that, and the base classes the generated code needs are emitted into
the module itself. A model with channels needs the runtime's `Chan1` and says
so with an import at the top -- the one exception, and it is visible.
