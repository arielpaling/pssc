"""What a generated Python symbol is called.

One module, because a name is decided in one place and reconstructed in
several: the register-model lowering DEFINES `regs_csr_read`, the body emitter
CALLS it, and the manifest reports it. Those were three hand-kept tables in the
C backend before `mem_access.py` collected them, and that history is the whole
reason this file exists at 60 lines rather than as three helpers scattered
across the backend.

Python identifiers are permissive enough that most PSS names pass through
unchanged, which is deliberate: a generated API whose members are spelled the
way the model spells them is one an author can navigate without a mapping
table. Only two things are rewritten -- a keyword collision, and a component
type name becoming a class name.
