"""``op-model-py``: a PSS operation model as a plain Python module.

The third language in the operation-model family, and the first one written
after the shared layer existed. That is its second job: the walk
(`body_walker.py`), the call dispatch (`call_legality.py`), the elaborated model
(`op_model.py`), the folded register layout (`reg_layout.py`) and the API-type
collection (`sv/lower_api_types.py`) are all consumed here rather than
reimplemented, so what is left -- `targets/py/` -- is the part that is actually
about Python.

Its first job is to be useful: a generated module drives a duck-typed bus, which
is what a cocotb bring-up, a socket-attached debugger or a pure-Python device
model already has.

Plan: P8.T1.
