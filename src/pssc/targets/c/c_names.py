"""Every file-scope name the generated C declares, and the check that no two
are the same.

C has ONE namespace for typedefs, functions and objects, and the backend fills
it from several rules at once: a component's type is its PSS name, its
operations and sub-component accessors are `<prefix>_<name>`, its lifecycle is
`<prefix>_init/_create/_destroy`, its register accessors are
`<prefix>_<path>_<reg>_<kind>`, and an import keeps its PSS name. Each rule is
collision-free on its own; together they are not. A sub-component named
`create` has the accessor `wb_dma_create` -- the lifecycle function's name --
and C reports that as a conflicting declaration somewhere in a header the user
did not write.

So the names are gathered from the same functions that spell them, and two
sources of one name are a `CompileError` naming both PSS sources, raised
before any file is written. Struct tags and macros are not gathered: a tag has
a namespace of its own, and the macros are counts in upper case.
