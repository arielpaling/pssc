"""Reject calls the backend cannot lower, before anything is written.

A PASS, not an exception inside the emitter, for three reasons (docs §5.1):

  1. It reports EVERY illegal call in one run. An exception raised from
     expression rendering aborts at the first, so a model with six unmapped
     calls would take six compiles to find out.
  2. It runs before any output file is opened. A failure part-way through
     emission leaves a truncated artifact on disk that a later dv-flow run may
     treat as up-to-date.
  3. It is testable without a backend.

The pass and the emitters share ONE registry (`call_legality`), so they cannot
drift into two independently maintained lists -- which is the failure mode this
design would otherwise introduce. The pass produces the user-facing diagnostic;
an emitter that nevertheless meets an unclassified call raises, because by then
the pass has vouched for it and arriving there is a compiler bug.
