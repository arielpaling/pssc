"""The operation model, generated end to end as a SystemVerilog package.

This is the component-tree projection: one class per component type with its
members under their PSS names, an `init` lowered into a method, the exports as
the context API, and `yield` as a zero delay. The model is presented with the
environment's exports (`op_model_sv_sources`): the device tree declares none,
and op-model-sv takes its API from exports only. The flat model
in `src/pssc/testing/models` covers the same backend from the other
direction, and both must keep working -- a change that fixes one and breaks the
other is not progress.

Assertions come in pairs wherever a defect had a plausible-looking output: the
absence checks (`has_not=`) are load-bearing, because an empty interface class
and a missing accessor both look like ordinary generated code.

The Verilator lint at the bottom is the cheapest strong signal available. It
does not prove the model is right; it proves the output is SystemVerilog, which
every structural assertion above quietly assumes.
