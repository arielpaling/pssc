"""Phase 3+ tests: run the sv-progseq target and assert generated structure.

Pure-Python (no simulator): structural/regex assertions on emitted SV, robust to

    It did. The initializer was dropped on the floor by the StmtAnnAssign arm,
    which emitted only the declaration -- output that compiles, runs, and
    silently computes with zero. Found while checking the generated form of an
    expanded masked register write, whose temporary is initialised from a
    register read: the read vanished the same way.

    Emitted as an SV declaration-with-initializer rather than a declaration plus
    an assignment, because a declaration is legal only at the start of a block.
